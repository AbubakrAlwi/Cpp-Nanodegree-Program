# Udacity - C++ Nanodegree Program
The program provides a structured approach to mastering modern C++ development, beginning with a deep dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Initially, the curriculum focuses on foundational OOP concepts, exploring class design, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. As the program progresses, it introduces advanced Modern C++ features, emphasizing contemporary programming techniques, memory management, and best practices.

## Build Instructions

See the build instructions in each project folder.

## [Project 1 - Route Planning]

Developed a route planner application that calculates the optimal path between two points using real-world map data, implementing the A* search algorithm. The project demonstrates advanced pathfinding techniques by efficiently processing geographical information and finding the most optimal route. By combining actual distance traveled with estimated distance to the destination, the application provides an intelligent navigation solution that balances computational efficiency with accurate route selection. The implementation involves working with complex data structures, applying graph-based navigation techniques, and creating a robust system for route optimization across real-world geographical contexts.

## [Project 2 - System Monitor]

In this project, we build a system monitor that resemble the program [htop](https://htop.dev/), which is a standard program for monitoring Linux systems.

## [Project 3 - Memory Management Chatbot]

In this project, we optimize a Chatbot program with modern c++ memory management method (e.g. smart pointer, move semantics).

## [Project 4 - Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation]

In this project, we build a multithreaded traffic simulator (vehicles, streets, intersections and traffic lights) using a real urban map. Each vehicle is run on a separate thread. And intersections are managed to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.
