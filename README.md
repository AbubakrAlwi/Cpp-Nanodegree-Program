## [Project 1 - Route Planning]

Developed a route planner application that calculates the optimal path between two points using real-world map data, implementing the A* search algorithm. The project demonstrates advanced pathfinding techniques by efficiently processing geographical information and finding the most optimal route. By combining actual distance traveled with estimated distance to the destination, the application provides an intelligent navigation solution that balances computational efficiency with accurate route selection. The implementation involves working with complex data structures, applying graph-based navigation techniques, and creating a robust system for route optimization across real-world geographical contexts.

## [Project 2 - System Monitor]
Developed a comprehensive system monitoring application modeled after [htop](https://htop.dev/), a widely-used Linux system monitoring tool. The project involves creating a sophisticated real-time system resource monitor that provides detailed insights into system performance, process management, and resource utilization. By implementing object-oriented design patterns and leveraging Linux system programming techniques, the application provides dynamic, real-time updates of system metrics, including CPU usage, memory consumption, and active processes. The monitor interacts with the Linux proc filesystem to collect and display system information, demonstrating advanced system programming skills and in-depth understanding of Linux system internals.

## [Project 3 - Memory Management Chatbot]

Developed an advanced Chatbot application focusing on optimizing memory management using modern C++ techniques. The project implements sophisticated memory handling strategies, including smart pointers and move semantics, to enhance performance and resource efficiency. By leveraging contemporary C++ memory management methodologies, the chatbot demonstrates improved memory allocation, reduced overhead, and more robust resource handling. The implementation showcases advanced C++ programming skills, emphasizing best practices in memory optimization, resource control, and intelligent memory lifecycle management.

## [Project 4 - Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation]

Developed an advanced multithreaded traffic simulation system that models urban transportation dynamics using real-world map data. The project creates a sophisticated simulation where each vehicle operates on a separate thread, enabling concurrent and realistic traffic movement. Implemented complex intersection management algorithms to optimize traffic flow and prevent potential collisions, demonstrating advanced multithreading techniques and concurrent programming principles. The simulation encompasses detailed modeling of vehicles, streets, intersections, and traffic lights, providing a comprehensive and dynamic representation of urban traffic interactions. By leveraging modern C++ concurrency features, the project showcases intelligent traffic management and parallel processing capabilities.
